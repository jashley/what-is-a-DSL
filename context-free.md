# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
It is for people who wish to create complicated images using only coding. As opposed to
Photoshop and its ilk.


## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is very easy to create basic shapes and draw recursive images. As this drawing is entirely
programmatic, these operations are very easy to perform in code.


## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
Doodling is almost impossible. Because you must specify exactly what you want the computer to do,
you must completely know what you are doing before starting.


## How did you learn how to program in this language?\
I looked up example code and a reference guide and molded my code to the examples, with additions from
the reference guide.


## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._
When a program runs, it determines a start rule, then executes a rule of that name.Based on a pre-defined
hierarchy, it performs its drawings in a certain order, then moves on to the next rule (if any).


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
Unlike any other language I've written in, ContextFree lets you define multiple functions with the same name.
This makes randomness a built-in aspect of the language. I did a tiny exploration into this (as well as its
_interesting_ method of determining color). In addition, loops are unlike anything I have seen before, so
I modified example code that produced a grid.
